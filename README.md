# Less distraction

This app enables people to share their content on Instagram with less distraction.

In most cases, Instagram users get distracted by the followers that violate paragraph 11 of Instagram's Terms of Use (i.e., submit unwanted forms of commercial or harassing communications).

An error-proof machine learning algorithm is used to detect such followers. The user reviews them and decides whether he or she wants to mute them to stay less distracted using Instagram.
